                My dear reader, website peruser, or potential partner in work, I
                am honored to have you spend your time here to show interest in
                getting to know me and my work. Writing is such a personal
                thing. If out of the heart the mouth speaks, then out of the
                soul does one write. Writing is not only therapeutic, it also
                frees up the world thatâ€™s inside a person. My writing and
                editing speciality is non-fiction. I am passionate about hearing
                the stories of others. To get to hear others share their stories
                is a gift and I want to help you get your story out. As an
                editor I am passionate about making your words concise and
                strong; to get your point across and to impact your readers.
                Here on my website is a collection of what makes me, well me.
                You will find a collection of my thoughts, books I love, and my
                newsletter. I hope you find this website enjoyable and feel free
                to reach me with any questions or to start a work partnership,
                or even just to share a book or podcast you discovered.
